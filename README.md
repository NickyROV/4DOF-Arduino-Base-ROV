# ROV
This is a DIY guide to ROV with Arudino Driven 4 DOF conrtol, I try to keep it simple both in hardware and software.
I try to git my log as frequent as possible.


In this project I try to use dual 2-DOF RC joy stick to control 4-DOF ROV (Surge, Sway, Heave and Yaw), the remaining (Pitch and Roll) can be achieved by installing extra thruster.

For simplicity I use Blue Robotic T200 Thruster with corresponding ESC (just because it's handy).

Tethering - RS485 Simplex communication

Sensor - none (depth-MS5540C, temperature, pressure, turbidity, compass, leak, dissolved oxygen, sonar mapping... are all feasible, maybe next time)
